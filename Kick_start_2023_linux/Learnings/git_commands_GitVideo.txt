0.0   mkdir GitVideo
0.1   touch index.html
1.0   git init (starts tracking the changes made(ie: files added, removed etc..) in GitVideo directory)
2.0   git status
3.0   git add index.html (file "index.html" will be added to "Staging area")
3.1   git add. (adds each and every file to Staging area)
4.0   git commit -m "created a file index.html"
5.0   git log (shows history of commits made)
6.0   git checkout <commit-hash> (get "hash" value using "git log" command)
7.0   git checkout master (Switch to the latest commit, that is on master branch)
8.0   git branch (lists all the branches)
          Sample Output:
          * master -> "*" indicates the "Current" branch we are at, in this case we are on master branch
          * (HEAD detached at 02bd91b)
            master -> in this case we are "currently" at a branch called (HEAD detached at 02bd91b)
8.1   git branch <new-branch-name> (to create a new branch)
          Eg:
          git branch crazycolors
          git checkout crazycolors (to switch to crazycolors branch)
